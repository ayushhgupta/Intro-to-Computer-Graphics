# Introduction to Computer Graphics

This project aimed at understanding the basics of Computer Graphics and implementing various kinds of graphics content (both 2D and 3D) using WebGL APIs.

It includes creating a 2D animated scene, implementing 3D shading techniques and texture mapping, performing image processing operations in GLSL, implementing ray-tracing algorithms.
